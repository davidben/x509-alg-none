Fortunately, the draft does not say this. The context implicitly referenced here is when validating a path or determining the authenticity of a trust anchor. A signature may be checked for other purposes. For example, self-signed-ness may be checked to decide how to handle a cert in support of basic cert store hygiene when installing a certificate (i.e., one doesn\u2019t need a self-signed cert in a pile of intermediates). Those apps would need to change. I think the draft should add some words about the need to recognize id-unsigned where use of self-signed-ness determination (i.e., signature verification) serves purposes other than validating a path or establishing a trust anchor\u2019s authenticity.\r\n\r\n> This is true, but some applications (like the Windows certificate viewer) give an integrity error if you replace a self-signed cert\u2019s algorithm and signature with an unrecognized OID and an empty BIT STRING. This application would need to change as a negative indicator like that may create confusion for some users when installing or viewing a root.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
